        QGIS methodology

Import DEM file, allbasins geojson, chi_data_map geojson, and CN geojson from lsdtopotools analysis 





Use join attributes by nearest to join chi_data and CN
    only take the stream order attribute
    
Reproject the joined layer to same crs as the .bil used in lsdtopotools anlaysis.


Convert allbasins geojson raster to vector using Polygonize

Join reprojected channel points by join with location , finding where the reprojected channel points are withing the vectorized allbasins layer.

Add x y data to joined river network layer
Export channels as channel csv file.this was called channel1.csv in our analysis


Run points along gemoetery for polygonized layer. This was done at 1 meter intevals for our analysis.


Add x y data to points along geomotry layer

Add elevation to the ridgeline data with sample raster, using the .bil from the lsdtopotools analysis for the elevation data.

Export the ridgeline data to cvs. this was called basins.csv in our analysis
